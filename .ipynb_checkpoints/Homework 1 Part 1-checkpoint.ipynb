    "Prostate cancer is the most common type of cancer found in  males. As an indicator of whether a male has prostate cancer,   doctors often perform a test that measures the level of the PSA (prostate specific antigen) protein that is produced only by the prostate gland.  Although PSA levels are indicative of cancer, the test is notoriously unreliable.  Indeed, the probability that a noncancerous man will have an elevated PSA level is approximately 0.135, with this probability increasing to approximately 0.268 if the man does have cancer.\n",
