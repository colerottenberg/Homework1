# Homework 1

**Due: Wednesday, September 14 @ 11:59PM**

All homework assignments have 2 parts: analytical (part 1) and Python simulations (part 2).

## Part 1 - Analytical

All questions in part 1 must be solved on paper. There is no need to type your answers with $\LaTeX$, just scan your handwritten solutions with an app like [CamScanner](https://www.camscanner.com/user/download).

Suppose you create a folder within your repository called "Figures" where you will include all of your handwritten scans (Figures/Q1.png and Figures/Q2.jpg). You can then import your images scans inside your Notebook. First, using a code cell, load the the function ```Image``` from ```IPython.display```.

````python
from IPython.display import Image
````

Next, load your handwritten solutions:

````python
Image(Figures/Q1.png, width=700)
````

````python
Image(Figures/Q2.jpg, width=500)
````

Remember to ```push``` the "Figures" folder to your repository.

All questions for part 1 can be found in the Notebook file "Homework 1 Part 1.ipynb".

## Part 2 - Simulations

All questions in part 2 must be solved using Python simulations. Please make sure your code is prepared with care, it contains comments when needed, and it is running. Utilize markdown cells to document your observations and answer questions based on your simulation results. 

Once you complete your answers, make sure all the code is running without errors. I recommend to restart the kernel and run all cells: click on ```Kernel > Restart & Run All```.

When printing your Jupyter notebook as a PDF, please review it and make sure all code is readable. 

All questions for part 2 can be found in the Notebook file "Homework 1 Part 2.ipynb".
